# GravitySims
A few Python files to simulate Gravity between Objects

  Sim1:
      Simple simulation of falling objects on planet earth

  Sim2:
      Simulation of 2 Bodys in Space. One is unmoving

  Sim3:
      Simulation of 2 Bodys in Space. Both are moving

  Sim4:
      Simulation of n Bodys in Space.

  Currently only Sim4 works without any changes to the code :(
